In this repository, I have created three image classifiers. I have used some librearies which is given below. 
<ul>
  <li>OpenCV</li>
  <li>sklearn</li>
  <li>Tensorflow</li>
  <li>keras</li>
</ul>  

<h1> Face classification.ipynb </h1>
    My first classifier is Face calassification. In this classification, I have used  SVM. Firstly, I took image from the users a and I collected hog features. After collecting hog features, I applied SVM. I used GridSearchCV for parameter tunning. At last I have calculated classification report and confution matrix. 
<h1> basic_image_classification.ipynb </h1>
    In this notebook i have made a classifier using feed Feedforward neural network. 
<h1> CNN.ipynb </h1>
    In this notebook i have made a classifier using CNN. 
 <h1>Face_Detection.ipynb</h1>
    It is my Face Detection Notebook. In this notebook i have detected face with confidence lavel.
